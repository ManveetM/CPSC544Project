# CPSC 544 Project
Authors: Collin Ho, Sehyeon Park, Manveet Mandal.\
This is for the University of Calgary's CPSC 544 class Final Project.
## Emotion classification of text
The goal of this project is to create an emotion classifier using a multinomial bayes model.

The roughWork folder contains our prototyping work and in general just a rough draft of what our final model is. The final model and all visualizations are contained in the notebook [complete.ipynb](complete.ipynb).

One can just run the code in the notebook to get the model and figures.

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the libraries we used. The project is fully contained in python.
